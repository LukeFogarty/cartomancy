GMTK2021 Game Jam Submission.

This was my idea for the Game Maker's Toolkit 2021 Game Jam. Unfortunately, I was a couple of hours off in the end, and did not get to submit the game in time, but I still had a lot of fun attempting it! (Not having premade the 3D assets really let me down!)

Anywauy, here are the scripts for the game, as well as a link to where you can play it. The code itself is hurriedly put together, and I am new to Unity, so it is very messy, but the game runs!

The aim of the game is to manipulate the map to navigate the level, and reach the crystal. When you rotate or flip the map, your character stays in place, allowing you to access new areas. There's 20 levels to try, and 100 coins to collect! 

Enjoy!
